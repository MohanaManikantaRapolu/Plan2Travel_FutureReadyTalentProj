Plan2Travel is a website which is basically helps the travelling lovers to make things so easier for them.that it means all the Beutiful locations across the world are shown at one place .this was developed with the help of the Azure.
Here i was used Azure Resource groups,Azure static web app services , and  also used vs code .
initially i was designed each page along with the different hyperlinks to navigate into the another pages. Later created one resource group in the Azure portal. and then created one Azure static web app  under the  previously created resource group.then the entire file are uploaded in the github.And later deployed the web app. So it is now live. this web app really so helpful to the travellers.we can also add so many locations in this web app.
